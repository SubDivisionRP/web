<h4>Rule 3: Roleplay Rules and Regulations</h4>
<br>
<ul class="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0.5em"></ul>
<h5><li>Inventory Usage</li></h5>
<p>You are not allowed to keep <strong>illegal things including guns in your secret pocket(6th pocket).</strong> When someone is patting you down , you also need to give hints to the person using /me command.
<br><br>
<strong>For Example</strong> :- If I have an ID-Card in my 6th pocket and someone is patting me down , then i will do /me Feels like ID Card in Back Pocket.
</p>
<br>
<h5><li>Random Deathmatch (RDM) & Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM)</li></h5>
<p>You are not allowed to kill any without any kind roleplay being involved. This also includes the use of vehicles as well.<br>Before a player can kill another player, all players must be engaged in role play</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 600;">Some Examples of RDM and VDM Scenarios are :</p>
<p>Intentionally running over someone to kill or slamming in your vehicle into a player without initiating any kind of roleplay with him.</p>
<p style="color: red;">Drive-By are allowed but pitting, ramming vehicles will result in a Warning/Ban.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Please keep one thing in mind, when performing a drive-by your vehicle must not have a back grille which prevents people from shooting you at the back.</p>
<br>
<h5><li>Realistic Behavior</li></h5>
<p>You must enact your character at all times; all the players are requested to conduct themselves in a realistic manner. Despite all the game mechanics, if you fail to act responsibly you might be banned/warned , you must act in a "realistic." manner at all times.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 600;">Some Examples of non Realistic Behavioral Scenarios are :</p>
<ol class="list">
<li><strong>If you are tazed by a person, you should not just get up and run around as if you felt nothing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Immediately just don’t start jumping/shooting/fighting when an EMS is treating you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>While Handcuffed you are not allowed to act which involves your hand movement like driving a car, opening doors, you can’t jump fences, wall or pull out firearms.
</strong></li>
</ol>
<br>
<h5><li>Meta-Gaming</li></h5>
<p>You are not allowed to use Player’s ID to find players hiding in bushes, buildings, water etc or inside vehicles with tinted windows.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 600;">Some Examples of Meta-gaming Scenarios are:</p>
<ol class="list">
<li><strong>Using outside character information to gain advantage in-character.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Using player’s STEAM NAME/Player ID when reporting to police without having any in-RP interactions with that player.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Not using in-game knowledge but using outside knowledge to gain advantage of things.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Using any outside game communication like Discord, Team Speak etc.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Do not use any information from YouTube/Loco/Discord video's to give you an advantage on situations or use the information even if you were not there.Even if you recognise someone by their voice you must not call them by their names as they might be on a different character.
</p>
<br>
<h5><li>Powergaming</li></h5>
<p>We would like to define power-gaming as the abuse of in-game mechanics to give you an unrealistic advantage.</p>
<br>
<h5><li>Fail RP</li></h5>
<p>You are not allowed to do FailRP at any instance of your roleplay which means no following RP Rules.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 600;">Some Examples of FailRP Scenarios are :</p>
<ol class="list">
<li><strong>Punching, Shooting, Tazing or stealing a card while being cuffed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Taking out a gun even after someone has done /me command for “Taking Gun”.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Giving out locations to friends even after death by explosion/execution etc.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Driving unrealistically like we tend to do in GTA Online</strong></li>
</ol>
<br>
<h5><li>Cop-baiting</li></h5>
<p>It’s strictly not allowed for players to bait officers.Let’s suppose if an officer is busy with a crime suitation such as a bank robbery or a murder or they are engaged in role play, you aren’t allowed to do actions which might lead breaking their RP.
</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 600;">Some Examples of Cop-Baiting</p>
<ol class="list">
<li><strong>Honking of horns unnecessary to annoy an officer who is on a traffic stop or speaking with another player.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Intentionally interfering with an ongoing roleplay situation just so to get attention from police.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Intentionally hitting,ramming,shooting or otherwise acting inappropriately in front of the police personnel without initiating a proper roleplay.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The crowding during a 10-90 is also considered as cop-baiting.</strong></li>
</ol>
<br>
<h5><li>Impersonating Players</li></h5>
<p>You are not allowed to impersonate any government members i.e Police,EMS etc.</p>
<br>
<h5><li>New Life Rules</li></h5>
<p>If you are ABLE to receive medical help and then be revived, you shall remember all the events which lead to that encounter. But if you are NOT able to get medical help and you respawn then you shall not remember the event which led to your death.If you are EXECUTED then you have to forget the whole situation even if someone tries to remind you about the situation.</p>
<p>Once you are down in combat you are not allowed to rejoin the situation in any manner whatsoever.</p>
<p>If you are deciding to end your character/deciding that your character is dead then you need to be sent to the morgue where EMS will declare you dead and only then you can DELETE THE CHARACTER.Taking PERMA means that you are dead and you are ending your character's existence. Your character shall no longer have warrants nor he would be subjected to jail sentences. </p>
<p>Every encounter must have adequate role play and should not be breaking any server rules. You can’t decide if another player is dead. It will be the responsibility of the downed player to decide their own fate.
</p>
